Android Application - Japanese Flashcard Game 
Version 1.20, May 2015 Release

I created this application to help me learn the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana alphabets.

This is an android application that continuously feeds you flashcards. I created a custom keyboard for this application, and all of the art was created by myself using Photoshop and Microsoft Japanese fonts.
