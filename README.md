Android Application - Japanese Flashcard Game [10.2014]

*DESIGNED FOR USE ON NEXUS5*

I created this application to help me learn the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana alphabets.

This is an android application that continuously feeds you flashcards. I created a custom keyboard for this application, and all of the art was created by myself.
